Netflix Recommendation System

This is a Netflix Recommendation System built using data mining and machine learning techniques. The system uses historical movie rating data and applies algorithms such as Apriori for association rules and other data processing methods to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and historical behavior.

Features

Movie Recommendations: Recommends movies based on users’ preferences using association rules and collaborative filtering.
Data Preprocessing: Data is processed using Pandas and cleaned to fit into the recommendation model.
Algorithms: Implements the Apriori Algorithm for association rules mining to recommend similar movies.
Visualization: Provides insights into frequently occurring itemsets and rules in movie data.
Technologies Used

Python: For implementing the entire recommendation system.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
MLxtend: For implementing the Apriori algorithm and generating association rules.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing frequent itemsets and rules.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for developing and testing the recommendation algorithms.
Installation

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy mlxtend matplotlib seaborn
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/urmishikha/Netflix-notebook.git
cd Netflix-notebook
Running the Code
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your local environment or via Google Colab.
Run the code in the notebook to process the dataset and generate movie recommendations.
Make sure to load the necessary data file (netflix-dataset.csv or equivalent).
Project Structure

netflix-dataset.csv: The dataset containing movie ratings and information about user interactions.
recommendation_system.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the recommendation system.
visualizations.ipynb: Visualizations of frequent itemsets and association rules.
Usage

Load the Dataset: The dataset is read from a CSV file. Make sure the file path is correct.
df = pd.read_csv('netflix-dataset.csv', header=None)
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and format the data into a suitable structure for the recommendation model.
Convert data into transactions for the Apriori algorithm.
Run the Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data to find frequent itemsets and association rules.
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
rules = apriori(t, min_support=0.003, min_confidence=0.2, min_lift=3)
Get Recommendations: Use the generated rules to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.
df_rules = association_rules(rules, metric="lift", min_threshold=3)
Visualize Results: Generate graphs and charts to visualize the frequent itemsets and rules.
Example Output

Recommendations: Based on the input data, the system will suggest movies like:
The Dark Knight → Inception
12 Angry Men → The Godfather
Frequent Itemsets Visualization: A bar chart showing the most frequently associated movie pairs.
